# Eductional cards games simulating evolution
## Two games have been so far been implemented:
* Genetic drift (Wright Fisher model):
** R code: "genetic-drift.R"
** Python code: "./wright-fisher-simulator.py" (functions in "drift.py")
* Red Queen evolution (frequency-depdent evolution)
** R code: "red-queen.R"
